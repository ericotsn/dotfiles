# Eric's dotfiles

These are my personal configuration files for various tools and
applications, shared across macOS and Linux. I manage them with
[chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io), which makes it easy to handle host-
and system-specific settings.

Feel free to take inspiration and copy anything you find useful! Or
install them as-is (not recommended) with the following command:

```sh
chezmoi init https://github.com/ericotsn/dotfiles.git
```
